# Features in peddy service

### 1. Category-wise Data Display:

- Our platform offers a seamless experience to browse animals categorized by species or specific traits. Users can select categories such as Dogs, Cats, Birds, and Rabbit to view available pets that match their preferences. By organizing pets into categories, the platform ensures easy navigation and helps users find their desired companion quickly and efficiently.
### 2. Price-wise Descending Sorting:

- The animal listings can be sorted based on price, making it convenient for users to filter pets according to their budget. With the Price-wise Descending Sorting feature, users can view animals starting from the highest to the lowest price. This sorting option is especially useful for those seeking premium breeds or specific pets within a certain price range.
### 3. Favorite Animal Selection:

- Users can express their interest by adding animals to their Favorites list using the Like button. This feature helps users keep track of the pets they are interested in and provides a personalized experience. Favorited animals are saved in a dedicated section, allowing users to review and compare their choices before making an adoption decision.
### 4. Adopt Button with Countdown Timer and Disable Function:

- When a user clicks on the Adopt button, a countdown timer appears, providing a brief waiting period before the action is confirmed. During this countdown, the Adopt button is temporarily disabled to prevent accidental multiple submissions. After the countdown completes, the adoption process is initiated, and the button remains disabled to indicate that the adoption request is being processed. This feature ensures a smooth user experience and helps manage concurrent adoption requests effectively.
### 5. Animal Details View:

- Clicking the Details button opens a detailed profile of the selected animal. This profile includes comprehensive information such as breed, age, gender, vaccination status and price. The details view is presented in a modal or separate section, allowing users to gain deeper insights into the animalâ€™s characteristics before making an adoption decision. This feature ensures that users are well-informed and helps in building trust and transparency in the adoption process.
